**Challenge Name:** PicoCTF 2023 | findme  
**Category:** Web Exploitations\
**Difficulty:** Medium

#### Description
Help us test the form by submitting the username as <o>test</o> and password as <o>test!</o>

#### Start üíª
Looking at the description, the author just simply tells us to test submit form with username <o>test</o> and password <o>test</o>.

Let's run the web application and test it.

as you can see below when i'm trying to submit username as <o>test</o> and password as <o>test</o> I get this text:

 so i try to submit with value of username <o>test</o> and password <o>test!</o>\
 and we get redirected to /home

 The first thing I try here is type flags in search box and submit it and i get nothing

then i try to read the source code and see nothing suspicious here.

so i paused for a moment and reread the description and content on the /home page, and I have no idea where the flag is, so i look at the hints and the hints say "<g>any redirections?</g>" hmm Was i being redirected? i didn't realize I had been redirected.\

so i try to go back with back button and look at the page, and I see nothing useful on the page and then I notice something on the url that the url end with "<o>==</o>" isn't this usually used for <g>base64</g> text? so I copy the value and paste it to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and as you can see below I get half of the flag, and I think it's the second piece of the flags.

So I try to redirect back again using back button and paste the url again to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
