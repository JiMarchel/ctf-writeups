**Challenge Name:** PicoCTF 2023 | findme  
**Category:** Web Exploitations
**Difficulty:** Medium

#### Description
Help us test the form by submitting the username as `test` and password as `test!`

#### Start üíª
Looking at the description, the author simply tells us to test the form with username `test` and password `test`.

Let's run the web application and test it.

As you can see below, when I'm trying to submit username as `test` and password as `test`, I get this text:

So I try to submit with username `test` and password `test!`, and we get redirected to /home.

The first thing I try here is typing "flag" in the search box and submitting it, but I get nothing.

Then I try to read the source code and see nothing suspicious here.

So I pause for a moment and reread the description and content on the /home page. I have no idea where the flag is, so I look at the hints and the hints say "any redirections?" Hmm, was I being redirected? I didn't realize I had been redirected.

So I try to go back with the back button and look at the page. I see nothing useful on the page, and then I notice something on the URL - it ends with `==`. Isn't this usually used for `base64` text? So I copy the value and paste it to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), and as you can see below, I get half of the flag. I think it's the second piece of the flag.

So I try to redirect back again using the back button and paste the URL again to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

And we got the flag! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
