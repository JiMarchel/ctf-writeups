#### Descriptons
Help us test the form by submiting the username as <o>test</o> and password as <o>test!</o>

#### Start üíª
When we look at the description, the author just simply tells us to test submit form with username <o>test</o> and password <o>test</o>.

so let's running the web and test it.

so i paused for a moment and reread the description and content on the /home page, and i have no idea where is the flag, so i look at the hints and the hints say "<g>any redirections?</g>" hmm was i being redirect? i didn't realize I had been redirected.\

so i try to go back with back button and look at the page, and i had see nothing useful on the page and then i notice something on the url that the url end with "<o>==</o>" isn't this usually used for <g>base64</g> text? so i copy the value and paste it to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and as you can see below i got the half of the flag, and i think its the second flags.
